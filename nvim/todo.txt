Reasonable and usable code folding
----------------------------------
- code folding, ideally with arrow in the gutter that can be mouse clicked
- it should be possible to fold code with simple key bindings as well,
  something similar to what JetBrains IDEs have

Jump to symbols in source code
------------------------------
- read docs of anyjump and find if I can jump to symbols in file / files from
  project root directory onward
- if not find a different way of doing that

Shift-backspace delete whole previous word
------------------------------------------
- for now I have a workaround with \-backspace in normal mode

Script for autoinstall of dotfiles on new systems
-------------------------------------------------
- running one script should install everything necessary

Clean up project a bit
----------------------
- .vim and .vimrc have accumulated some unnecessary things, clean it up
- maybe delete all the submodules, and rather download them when installing
  the same way as I have it for neovim

Add indent guides
-----------------

Highlight whitespace when selected in visual mode
-------------------------------------------------
